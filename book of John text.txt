In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God The same was in the beginning with God All things were made through him and wit him was not anything made that  been made In him was life and the life was the light of men And the light shineth in the darkness and the darkness apprehended it not There came a man sent from God whose name was John The same came for witness that he might bear witness of the light that all might believe through him He was not the light but came that he might bear witness of the light There was the true light even the light which lighteth every man coming into the world He was in the world and the world was made through him and the world knew him not He came  his own and they that were his own received him not But as many as received him to them gave he the right to become children of God even to them that believe on his name who were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory glory as of the only begotten from the Father full of grace and truth John beareth witness of him and crieth saying This was he of whom I  He that cometh after me is become before me for he was before me For of his fulness we all received and grace for grace For the law was given through Moses grace and truth came through Jesus Christ No man  seen God at any time the only begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father he  declared him And this is the witness of John when the Jews sent  him from Jerusalem priests and Levites to ask him Who art ? And he confessed and denied not and he confessed I am not the Christ And they asked him What then? Art  Elijah And he  I am not Art  the prophet And he answered No They  therefore  him Who art  that we may give an answer to them that sent us What sast  of thyself He  I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness Make straight the way of the Lord as  Isaiah the prophet And they had been sent from the Pharisees And they asked him and   him Why then baptizest  if  art not the Christ neither Elijah neither the prophet John answered them saying I baptize in water in the midst of you standeth one whom  know not even he that cometh after me the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to unloose These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan where John was baptizing On the morrow he seeth Jesus coming  him and  Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world! This is he of whom I  After me cometh a man who is become before me for he was before me And I knew him not but that he should be made manifest to Israel for this cause came I baptizing in water And John bare witness saying I have beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven and it abode upon him And I knew him not but he that sent me to baptize in water he   me Upon whomsoever  shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding upon him the same is he that baptizeth in the Holy Spirit And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God Again on the morrow John was standing and two of his disciples and he looked upon Jesus as he walked and  Behold the Lamb of God! And the two disciples heard him speak and they followed Jesus And Jesus turned and beheld them following and   them What seek  And they   him Rabbi which is to say being interpreted Teacher where abideth  He   them Come and  shall see They came therefore and saw where he abode and they abode with him that day it was about the tenth hour One of the two that heard John speak and followed him was Andrew Simon Peter's brother He findeth first his own brother Simon and   him We have found the Messiah which is being interpreted Christ He brought him  Jesus Jesus looked upon him and   art Simon the son of John  shalt be called Cephas which is by interpretation Peter On the morrow he was minded to go forth into Galilee and he findeth Philip and Jesus   him Follow me Now Philip was from Betha of the city of Andrew and Peter Philip findeth Nathanael and   him We have found him of whom Moses in the law and the prophets wrote Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph And Nathanael   him Can any good thing come out of Nazareth Philip   him Come and see Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him and  of him Behold an Israelite indeed in whom is no guile! Nathanael   him Whence knowest  me Jesus answered and   him Before Philip called  when  wast under the fig tree I saw  Nathanael answered him Rabbi  art the Son of God  art King of Israel Jesus answered and   him Because I    I saw  underneath the fig tree believest   shalt see greater things than these And he   him Verily verily I say  you  shall see the heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee and the mother of Jesus was there and Jesus also was bidden and his disciples to the marriage And when the wine failed the mother of Jesus   him They have no wine And Jesus   her Woman what have I to do with  mine hour is not t come His mother   the servants Whatsoever he   you do it Now there were six waterpots of stone set there after the Jews' manner of purifying containing two or three firkins apiece Jesus   them Fill the waterpots with water And they filled them up to the brim And he   them Draw out now and bear  the ruler of the feast And they bare it And when the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine and knew not whence it was but the servants that had drawn the water knew the ruler of the feast calleth the bridegroom and   him Every man setteth on first the good wine and when men have drunk freely then that which is worse   kept the good wine until now This beginning of his signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee and manifested his glory and his disciples believed on him After this he went down to Capernaum he and his mother and his brethren and his disciples and there they abode not many days And the passover of the Jews was at hand and Jesus went up to Jerusalem And he found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves and the changers of money sitting and he made a scourge of cords and cast all out of the temple both the sheep and the oxen and he poured out the changers' money and overthrew their tables and to them that sold the doves he  Take these things hence make not my Father's house a house of merchandise His disciples remembered that it was written Zeal for thy house shall eat me up The Jews therefore answered and   him What sign showest   us seeing that  doest these things Jesus answered and   them Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up The Jews therefore  Forty and six ars was this temple in building and wilt  raise it up in three days But he spake of the temple of his body When therefore he was raised from the dead his disciples remembered that he spake this and they believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had  Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover during the feast many believed on his name beholding his signs which he did But Jesus did not trust himself  them for that he knew all men and because he needed not that any one should bear witness concerning man for he himself knew what was in man Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came  him by night and  to him Rabbi we know that  art a teacher come from God for no one can do these signs that  doest except God be with him Jesus answered and   him Verily verily I say   Except one be born anew he cannot see the kingdom of God Nicodemus   him How can a man be born when he is old can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born Jesus answered Verily verily I say   Except one be born of water and the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God! That which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit Marvel not that I     must be born anew The wind bloweth where it will and  hearest the voice thereof but knowest not whence it cometh and whither it goeth so is every one that is born of the Spirit Nicodemus answered and   him How can these things be Jesus answered and   him Art  the teacher of Israel and understandest not these things Verily verily I say   We speak that which we know and bear witness of that which we have seen and  receive not our witness If I told you earthly things and  believe not how shall  believe if I tell you heavenly things And no one  ascended into heaven but he that descended out of heaven even the Son of man who is in heaven And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the Son of man be lifted up that whosoever believeth may in him have eternal life For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believeth on him should not perish but have eternal life For God sent not the Son into the world to judge the world but that the world should be saved through him He that believeth on him is not judged he that believeth not  been judged already because he  not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God And this is the judgment that the light is come into the world and men loved the darkness rather than the light for their works were evil For every one that doeth evil hateth the light and cometh not to the light lest his works should be reproved But he that doeth the truth cometh to the light that his works may be made manifest that they have been wrought in God After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judea and there he tarried with them and baptized And John also was baptizing in Enon near to Salim because there was much water there and they came and were baptized For John was not t cast into prison There arose therefore a questioning on the part of John's disciples with a Jew about purifying And they came  John and  to him Rabbi he that was with  beyond the Jordan to whom   borne witness behold the same baptizeth and all men come to him John answered and  A man can receive nothing except it have been given him from heaven  yourselves bear me witness that I  I am not the Christ but that I am sent before him He that  the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom that standeth and heareth him rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice this my joy therefore is made full He must increase but I must decrease He that cometh from above is above all he that is of the earth is of the earth and of the earth he speaketh he that cometh from heaven is above all What he  seen and heard of that he beareth witness and no man receiveth his witness He that  received his witness  set his seal to this that God is true For he whom God  sent speaketh the words of God for he giveth not the Spirit by measure The Father loveth the Son and  given all things into his hand He that believeth on the Son  eternal life but he that obeth not the Son shall not see life but the wrath of God abideth on him When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John algh Jesus himself baptized not but his disciples he left Judea and departed again into Galilee And he must needs pass through Samaria So he cometh to a city of Samaria called Sychar near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph and Jacob's well was there Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey sat thus by the well It was about the sixth hour There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water Jesus   her Give me to drink For his disciples were gone away into the city to buy food The Samaritan woman therefore   him How is it that  being a Jew askest drink of me who am a Samaritan woman For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans Jesus answered and    her If  knewest the gift of God and who it is that  to  Give me to drink  wouldest have asked of him and he would have given  living water The woman   him Sir   nothing to draw with and the well is deep whence then   that living water Art  greater than our father Jacob who gave us the well and drank thereof himself and his sons and his cattle Jesus answered and   her Every one that drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up  eternal life The woman   him Sir give me this water that I thirst not neither come all the way hither to draw Jesus   her Go call thy husband and come hither The woman answered and   him I have no husband Jesus   her  st well I have no husband for   had five husbands and he whom  now  is not thy husband this    truly The woman   him Sir I perceive that  art a prophet Our fathers worshipped in this mountain and  say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship Jesus   her Woman believe me the hour cometh when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem shall  worship the Father  worship that which  know not we worship that which we know for salvation is from the Jews But the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth for such doth the Father seek to be his worshippers God is a Spirit and they that worship him must worship in spirit and truth The woman   him I know that Messiah cometh he that is called Christ when he is come he will declare  us all things Jesus   her I that speak   am he And upon this came his disciples and they marvelled that he was speaking with a woman t no man  What seekest  or Why speakest  with her So the woman left her waterpot and went away into the city and  to the people Come see a man who told me all things that ever I did can this be the Christ They went out of the city and were coming to him In the mean while the disciples prad him saying Rabbi eat But he   them I have meat to eat that  know not The disciples therefore  one to another  any man brought him aught to eat Jesus   them My meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to accomplish his work Say not  There are t four months and then cometh the harvest behold I say  you Lift up your es and look on the fields that they are white already  harvest He that reapeth receiveth wages and gathereth fruit  life eternal that he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together For herein is the saying true One soweth and another reapeth I sent you to reap that whereon  have not labored others have labored and  are entered into their labor And from that city many of the Samaritans believed on him because of the word of the woman who testified He told me all things that ever I did So when the Samaritans came  him they besought him to abide with them and he abode there two days And many more believed because of his word and they  to the woman Now we believe not because of thy speaking for we have heard for ourselves and know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world And after the two days he went forth from thence into Galilee For Jesus himself testified that a prophet  no honor in his own country So when he came into Galilee the Galilaeans received him having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast for they also went  the feast He came therefore again  Cana of Galilee where he made the water wine And there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee he went  him and besought him that he would come down and heal his son for he was at the point of death Jesus therefore   him Except  see signs and wonders  will in no wise believe The nobleman   him Sir come down ere my child die Jesus   him Go thy way thy son liveth The man believed the word that Jesus spake  him and he went his way And as he was now going down his servants met him saying that his son lived So he inquired of them the hour when he began to amend They  therefore  him sterday at the seventh hour the fever left him So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus   him Thy son liveth and himself believed and his whole house This is again the second sign that Jesus did having come out of Judaea into Galilee After these things there was a feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep gate a pool which is called in Hebrew Bethesda having five porches In these lay a multitude of them that were sick blind halt withered waiting for the moving of the water for an angel of the Lord went down at certain seasons into the pool and troubled the water whosoever then first after the troubling of the waters stepped in was made whole with whatsoever disease he was holden And a certain man was there who had been thirty and eight ars in his infirmity When Jesus saw him lying and knew that he had been now a long time in that case he   him Wouldest  be made whole The sick man answered him Sir I have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool but while I am coming another steppeth down before me Jesus   him Arise take up thy bed and walk And straightway the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked Now it was the sabbath on that day So the Jews   him that was cured It is the sabbath and it is not lawful for  to take up thy bed But he answered them He that made me whole the same   me Take up thy bed and walk They asked him Who is the man that    Take up thy bed and walk But he that was healed knew not who it was for Jesus had conved himself away a multitude being in the place Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple and   him Behold  art made whole sin no more lest a worse thing befall  The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him whole And for this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus because he did these things on the sabbath But Jesus answered them My Father worketh even until now and I work For this cause therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him because he not only brake the sabbath but also called God his own Father making himself equal with God Jesus therefore answered and   them Verily verily I say  you The Son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the Father doing for what things soever he doeth these the Son also doeth in like manner For the Father loveth the Son and showeth him all things that himself doeth and greater works than these will he show him that  may marvel For as the Father raiseth the dead and giveth them life even so the Son also giveth life to whom he will For neither doth the Father judge any man but he  given all judgment  the Son that all may honor the Son even as they honor the Father He that honoreth not the Son honoreth not the Father that sent him Verily verily I say  you He that heareth my word and believeth him that sent me  eternal life and cometh not into judgment but  passed out of death into life Verily verily I say  you The hour cometh and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God and they that hear shall live For as the Father  life in himself even so gave he to the Son also to have life in himself and he gave him authority to execute judgment because he is a son of man Marvel not at this for the hour cometh in which all that are in the tombs shall hear his voice and shall come forth they that have done good  the resurrection of life and they that have done evil  the resurrection of judgment I can of myself do nothing as I hear I judge and my judgment is righteous because I seek not mine own will but the will of him that sent me If I bear witness of myself my witness is not true It is another that beareth witness of me and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true  have sent  John and he  borne witness  the truth But the witness which I receive is not from man howbeit I say these things that  may be saved He was the lamp that burneth and shineth and  were willing to rejoice for a season in his light But the witness which I have is greater than that of John for the works which the Father  given me to accomplish the very works that I do bear witness of me that the Father  sent me And the Father that sent me he  borne witness of me  have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his form And  have not his word abiding in you for whom he sent him  believe not  search the scriptures because  think that in them  have eternal life and these are they which bear witness of me and  will not come to me that  may have life I receive not glory from men But I know you that  have not the love of God in yourselves I am come in my Father's name and  receive me not if another shall come in his own name him  will receive How can  believe who receive glory one of another and the glory that cometh from the only God  seek not Think not that I will accuse you to the Father there is one that accuseth you even Moses on whom  have set your hope For if  believed Moses  would believe me for he wrote of me But if  believe not his writings how shall  believe my words After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee which is the sea of Tiberias And a great multitude followed him because they beheld the signs which he did on them that were sick And Jesus went up into the mountain and there he sat with his disciples Now the passover the feast of the Jews was at hand Jesus therefore lifting up his es and seeing that a great multitude cometh  him   Philip Whence are we to buy bread that these may eat And this he  to prove him for he himself knew what he would do Philip answered him Two hundred shillings' worth of bread is not sufficient for them that every one may take a little One of his disciples Andrew Simon Peter's brother   him There is a lad here who  five barley loaves and two fishes but what are these among so many Jesus  Make the people sit down Now there was much grass in the place So the men sat down in number about five sand Jesus therefore took the loaves and having given thanks he distributed to them that were set down likewise also of the fishes as much as they would And when they were filled he   his disciples Gather up the broken pieces which remain over that nothing be lost So they gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves which remained over  them that had eaten When therefore the people saw the sign which he did they  This is of a truth the prophet that cometh into the world Jesus therefore perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king withdrew again into the mountain himself alone And when evening came his disciples went down  the sea and they entered into a boat and were going over the sea  Capernaum And it was now dark and Jesus had not t come to them And the sea was rising by reason of a great wind that blew When therefore they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs they behold Jesus walking on the sea and drawing nigh  the boat and they were afraid But he   them It is I be not afraid They were willing therefore to receive him into the boat and straightway the boat was at the land whither they were going On the morrow the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there save one and that Jesus entered not with his disciples into the boat but that his disciples went away alone howbeit there came boats from Tiberias nigh  the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks when the multitude therefore saw that Jesus was not there neither his disciples they themselves got into the boats and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus And when they found him on the other side of the sea they   him Rabbi when camest  hither Jesus answered them and  Verily verily I say  you  seek me not because  saw signs but because  ate of the loaves and were filled Work not for the food which perisheth but for the food which abideth  eternal life which the Son of man shall give  you for him the Father even God  sealed They  therefore  him What must we do that we may work the works of God Jesus answered and   them This is the work of God that  believe on him whom he  sent They  therefore  him What then doest  for a sign that we may see and believe  what workest  Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness as it is written He gave them bread out of heaven to eat Jesus therefore   them Verily verily I say  you It was not Moses that gave you the bread out of heaven but my Father giveth you the true bread out of heaven For the bread of God is that which cometh down out of heaven and giveth life  the world They  therefore  him Lord evermore give us this bread Jesus   them I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall not hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst But I   you that  have seen me and t believe not All that which the Father giveth me shall come  me and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out For I am come down from heaven not to do mine own will but the will of him that sent me And this is the will of him that sent me that of all that which he  given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up at the last day For this is the will of my Father that every one that beholdeth the Son and believeth on him should have eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day The Jews therefore murmured concerning him because he  I am the bread which came down out of heaven And they  Is not this Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and mother we know how doth he now say I am come down out of heaven Jesus answered and   them Murmur not among yourselves No man can come to me except the Father that sent me draw him and I will raise him up in the last day It is written in the prophets And they shall all be taught of God Every one that  heard from the Father and  learned cometh  me Not that any man  seen the Father save he that is from God he  seen the Father Verily verily I say  you He that believeth  eternal life I am the bread of life Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness and they died This is the bread which cometh down out of heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die I am the living bread which came down out of heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live for ever a and the bread which I will give is my flesh for the life of the world The Jews therefore strove one with another saying How can this man give us his flesh to eat Jesus therefore   them Verily verily I say  you Except  eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood  have not life in yourselves He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood  eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day For my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood abideth in me and I in him As the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father so he that eateth me he also shall live because of me This is the bread which came down out of heaven not as the fathers ate and died he that eateth this bread shall live for ever These things  he in the synagogue as he taught in Capernaum Many therefore of his disciples when the heard this  This is a hard saying who can hear it But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this   them Doth this cause you to stumble What then if  should behold the Son of man ascending where he was before It is the spirit that giveth life the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I have spoken  you are spirit are are life But there are some of you that believe not For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not and who it was that should betray him And he  For this cause have I   you that no man can come  me except it be given  him of the Father Upon this many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him Jesus  therefore  the twelve Would  also go away Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go   the words of eternal life And we have believed and know that  art the Holy One of God Jesus answered them Did not I choose you the twelve and one of you is a devil Now he spake of Judas the son of Simon Iscariot for he it was that should betray him being one of the twelve And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee for he would not walk in Judaea because the Jews sought to kill him Now the feast of the Jews the feast of tabernacles was at hand His brethren therefore   him Depart hence and go into Judaea that thy disciples also may behold thy works which  doest For no man doeth anything in secret and himself seeketh to be known openly If  doest these things manifest thyself to the world For even his brethren did not believe on him Jesus therefore   them My time is not t come but your time is always ready The world cannot hate you but me it hateth because I testify of it that its works are evil Go  up  the feast I go not up  this feast because my time is not t fulfilled And having  these things  them he abode still in Galilee But when his brethren were gone up  the feast then went he also up not publicly but as it were in secret The Jews therefore sought him at the feast and  Where is he And there was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him some  He is a good man others  Not so but he leadeth the multitude astray t no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews But when it was now the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and taught The Jews therefore marvelled saying How knoweth this man letters having never learned Jesus therefore answered them and  My teaching is not mine but his that sent me If any man willeth to do his will he shall know of the teaching whether it is of God or whether I speak from myself He that speaketh from himself seeketh his own glory but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him the same is true and no unrighteousness is in him Did not Moses give you the law and t none of you doeth the law Why seek  to kill me The multitude answered   a demon who seeketh to kill  Jesus answered and   them I did one work and  all marvel because thereof Moses  given you circumcision not that it is of Moses but of the fathers and on the sabbath  circumcise a man If a man receiveth circumcision on the sabbath that the law of Moses may not be broken are  wroth with me because I made a man every whit whole on the sabbath Judge not according to appearance but judge righteous judgment Some therefore of them of Jerusalem  Is not this he whom they seek to kill And lo he speaketh openly and they say nothing  him Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the Christ Howbeit we know this man whence he is but when the Christ cometh no one knoweth whence he is Jesus therefore cried in the temple teaching and saying  both know me and know whence I am and I am not come of myself but he that sent me is true whom  know not I know him because I am from him and he sent me They sought therefore to take him and no man laid his hand on him because his hour was not t come But of the multitude many believed on him and they  When the Christ shall come will he do more signs than those which this man  done The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to take him Jesus therefore  t a little while am I with you and I go  him that sent me  shall seek me and shall not find me and where I am  cannot come The Jews therefore  among themselves Whither will this man go that we shall not find him will he go  the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks What is this word that he   shall seek me and shall not find me and where I am  cannot come Now on the last day the great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying If any man thirst let him come  me and drink He that believeth on me as the scripture   from within him shall flow rivers of living water But this spake he of the Spirit which they that believed on him were to receive for the Spirit was not t given because Jesus was not t glorified Some of the multitude therefore when they heard these words  This is of a truth the prophet Others  This is the Christ But some  What doth the Christ come out of Galilee  not the scripture  that the Christ cometh of the seed of David and from Bethlehem the village where David was So there arose a division in the multitude because of him And some of them would have taken him but no man laid hands on him The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees and they   them Why did  not bring him The officers answered Never man so spake The Pharisees therefore answered them Are  also led astray  any of the rulers believed on him or of the Pharisees But this multitude that knoweth not the law are accursed Nicodemus   them he that came to him before being one of them Doth our law judge a man except it first hear from himself and know what he doeth They answered and   him Art  also of Galilee Search and see that out of Galilee ariseth no prophet And they went every man  his own house but Jesus went  the mount of Olives And early in the morning he came again into the temple and all the people came  him and he sat down and taught them And the scribes and the Pharisees bring a woman taken in adultery and having set her in the midst they say  him Teacher this woman  been taken in adultery in the very act Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such what then sast  of her And this they  trying him that they might have whereof to accuse him But Jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground But when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and   them He that is wit sin among you let him first cast a stone at her And again he stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground And they when they heard it went out one by one beginning from the eldest even  the last and Jesus was left alone and the woman where she was in the midst And Jesus lifted up himself and   her Woman where are they did no man condemn  And she  No man Lord And Jesus  Neither do I condemn  go thy way from henceforth sin no more Again therefore Jesus spake  them saying I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in the darkness but shall have the light of life The Pharisees therefore   him  bearest witness of thyself thy witness is not true Jesus answered and   them Even if I bear witness of myself my witness is true for I know whence I came and whither I go but  know not whence I come or whither I go  judge after the flesh I judge no man a and if I judge my judgment is true for I am not alone but I and the Father that sent me a and in your law it is written that the witness of two men is true I am he that beareth witness of myself and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me They  therefore  him Where is thy Father Jesus answered  know neither me nor my Father if  knew me  would know my Father also These words spake he in the treasury as he taught in the temple and no man took him because his hour was not t come He  therefore again  them I go away and  shall seek me and shall die in your sin whither I go  cannot come The Jews therefore  Will he kill himself that he  Whither I go  cannot come And he   them  are from beneath I am from above  are of this world I am not of this world I  therefore  you that  shall die in your sins for except  believe that I am he  shall die in your sins They  therefore  him Who art  Jesus   them Even that which I have also spoken  you from the beginning I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you howbeit he that sent me is true and the things which I heard from him these speak I  the world They perceived not that he spake to them of the Father Jesus therefore  When  have lifted up the Son of man then shall  know that I am he and that I do nothing of myself but as the Father taught me I speak these things And he that sent me is with me he  not left me alone for I do always the things that are pleasing to him As he spake these things many believed on him Jesus therefore  to those Jews that had believed him If  abide in my word then are  truly my disciples and  shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free They answered  him We are Abraham's seed and have never t been in bondage to any man how sast   shall be made free Jesus answered them Verily verily I say  you Every one that committeth sin is the bondservant of sin And the bondservant abideth not in the house for ever the son abideth for ever If therefore the Son shall make you free  shall be free indeed I know that  are Abraham's seed t  seek to kill me because my word  not free course in you I speak the things which I have seen with my Father and  also do the things which  heard from your father They answered and   him Our father is Abraham Jesus   them If  were Abraham's children  would do the works of Abraham But now  seek to kill me a man that  told you the truth which I heard from God this did not Abraham  do the works of your father They   him We were not born of fornication we have one Father even God Jesus   them If God were your Father  would love me for I came forth and am come from God for neither have I come of myself but he sent me Why do  not understand my speech Even because  cannot hear my word  are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father it is your will to do He was a murderer from the beginning and standeth not in the truth because there is no truth in him When he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father thereof But because I say the truth  believe me not Which of you convicteth me of sin If I say truth why do  not believe me He that is of God heareth the words of God for this cause  hear them not because  are not of God The Jews answered and   him Say we not well that  art a Samaritan and  a demon Jesus answered I have not a demon but I honor my Father and  dishonor me But I seek not mine own glory there is one that seeketh and judgeth Verily verily I say  you If a man keep my word he shall never see death The Jews   him Now we know that   a demon Abraham died and the prophets and  sast If a man keep my word he shall never taste of death Art  greater than our father Abraham who died and the prophets died whom makest  thyself Jesus answered If I glorify myself my glory is nothing it is my Father that glorifieth me of whom  say that he is your God and  have not known him but I know him and if I should say I know him not I shall be like  you a liar but I know him and keep his word Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw it and was glad The Jews therefore   him  art not t fifty ars old and   seen Abraham Jesus   them Verily verily I say  you Before Abraham was born I am They took up stones therefore to cast at him but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple And as he passed by he saw a man blind from his birth And his disciples asked him saying Rabbi who sinned this man or his parents that he should be born blind Jesus answered Neither did this man sin nor his parents but that the works of God should be made manifest in him We must work the works of him that sent me while it is day the night cometh when no man can work When I am in the world I am the light of the world When he had thus spoken he spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and anointed his es with the clay and   him Go wash in the pool of Siloam which is by interpretation Sent He went away therefore and washed and came seeing The neighbors therefore and they that saw him aforetime that he was a beggar  Is not this he that sat and begged Others  It is he others  No but he is like him He  I am he They  therefore  him How then were thine es opened He answered The man that is called Jesus made clay and anointed mine es and   me Go to Siloam and wash so I went away and washed and I received sight And they   him Where is he He  I know not They bring to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind Now it was the sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay and opened his es Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight And he   them He put clay upon mine es and I washed and I see Some therefore of the Pharisees  This man is not from God because he keepeth not the sabbath But others  How can a man that is a sinner do such signs And there was division among them They say therefore  the blind man again What sast  of him in that he opened thine es And he  He is a prophet The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him that he had been blind and had received his sight until they called the parents of him that had received his sight and asked them saying Is this your son who  say was born blind How then doth he now see His parents answered and  We know that this is our son and that he was born blind but how he now seeth we know not or who opened his es we know not ask him he is of age he shall speak for himself These things  his parents because they feared the Jews for the Jews had agreed already that if any man should confess him to be Christ he should be put out of the synagogue Therefore  his parents He is of age ask him So they called a second time the man that was blind and   him Give glory to God we know that this man is a sinner He therefore answered Whether he is a sinner I know not one thing I know that whereas I was blind now I see They  therefore  him What did he to  How opened he thine es He answered them I told you even now and  did not hear wherefore would  hear it again would  also become his disciples And they reviled him and   art his disciple but we are disciples of Moses We know that God  spoken  Moses but as for this man we know not whence he is The man answered and   them Why herein is the marvel that  know not whence he is and t he opened mine es We know that God heareth not sinners but if any man be a worshipper of God and do his will him he heareth Since the world began it was never heard that any one opened the es of a man born blind If this man were not from God he could do nothing They answered and   him  wast altogether born in sins and dost  teach us And they cast him out Jesus heard that they had cast him out and finding him he  Dost  believe on the Son of God He answered and  And who is he Lord that I may believe on him Jesus   him   both seen him and he it is that speaketh with  And he  Lord I believe And he worshipped him And Jesus  For judgment came I into this world that they that see not may see and that they that see may become blind Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things and   him Are we also blind Jesus   them If  were blind  would have no sin but now  say We see your sin remaineth Verily verily I say  you He that entereth not by the door into the fold of the sheep but climbeth up some other way the same is a thief and a robber But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep To him the porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them out When he  put forth all his own he goeth before them and the sheep follow him for they know his voice And a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers This parable spake Jesus  them but they understood not what things they were which he spake  them Jesus therefore   them again Verily verily I say  you I am the door of the sheep All that came before me are thieves and robbers but the sheep did not hear them I am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and go out and shall find pasture The thief cometh not but that he may steal and kill and destroy I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly I am the good shepherd the good shepherd lath down his life for the sheep He that is a hireling and not a shepherd whose own the sheep are not beholdeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and fleeth and the wolf snatcheth them and scattereth them he fleeth because he is a hireling and careth not for the sheep I am the good shepherd and I know mine own and mine own know me even as the Father knoweth me and I know the Father and I lay down my life for the sheep And other sheep I have which are not of this fold them also I must bring and they shall hear my voice and they shall become one flock one shepherd Therefore doth the Father love me because I lay down my life that I may take it again No one taketh it away from me but I lay it down of myself I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it again This commandment received I from my Father There arose a division again among the Jews because of these words And many of them  He  a demon and is mad why hear  him Others  These are not the sayings of one possessed with a demon Can a demon open the es of the blind And it was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem it was winter and Jesus was walking in the temple in Solomon's porch The Jews therefore came round about him and   him How long dost  hold us in suspense If  art the Christ tell us plainly Jesus answered them I told you and  believe not the works that I do in my Father's name these bear witness of me But  believe not because  are not of my sheep My sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give  them eternal life and they shall never perish and no one shall snatch them out of my hand My Father who  given them  me is greater than all and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand I and the Father are one The Jews took up stones again to stone him Jesus answered them Many good works have I showed you from the Father for which of those works do  stone me The Jews answered him For a good work we stone  not but for blasphemy and because that  being a man makest thyself God Jesus answered them Is it not written in your law I   are gods If he called them gods  whom the word of God came and the scripture cannot be broken say  of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world  blasphemest because I  I am the Son of God If I do not the works of my Father believe me not But if I do them gh  believe not me believe the works that  may know and understand that the Father is in me and I in the Father They sought again to take him and he went forth out of their hand And he went away again beyond the Jordan into the place where John was at the first baptizing and there be abode And many came  him and they  John indeed did no sign but all things whatsoever John spake of this man were true And many believed on him there Now a certain man was sick Lazarus of Bethany of the village of Mary and her sister Martha And it was that Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother Lazarus was sick The sisters therefore sent  him saying Lord behold he whom  lovest is sick But when Jesus heard it he  This sickness is not  death but for the glory of God that the Son of God may be glorified thereby Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus When therefore he heard that he was sick he abode at that time two days in the place where he was Then after this he  to the disciples Let us go into Judaea again The disciples say  him Rabbi the Jews were but now seeking to stone  and goest  thither again Jesus answered Are there not twelve hours in the day If a man walk in the day he stumbleth not because he seeth the light of this world But if a man walk in the night he stumbleth because the light is not in him These things spake he and after this he   them Our friend Lazarus is fallen asleep but I go that I may awake him out of sleep The disciples therefore   him Lord if he is fallen asleep he will recover Now Jesus had spoken of his death but they ght that he spake of taking rest in sleep Then Jesus therefore   them plainly Lazarus is dead And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there to the intent  may believe nevertheless let us go  him Thomas therefore who is called Didymus   his fellow-disciples Let us also go that we may die with him So when Jesus came he found that he had been in the tomb four days already Now Bethany was nigh  Jerusalem about fifteen furlongs off and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them concerning their brother Martha therefore when she heard that Jesus was coming went and met him but Mary still sat in the house Martha therefore   Jesus Lord if  hadst been here my brother had not died And even now I know that whatsoever  shalt ask of God God will give  Jesus   her Thy brother shall rise again Martha   him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day Jesus   her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth on me gh he die t shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth on me shall never die Believest  this She   him a Lord I have believed that  art the Christ the Son of God even he that cometh into the world And when she had  this she went away and called Mary her sister secretly saying The Teacher is her and calleth  And she when she heard it arose quickly and went  him Now Jesus was not t come into the village but was still in the place where Martha met him The Jews then who were with her in the house and were consoling her when they saw Mary that she rose up quickly and went out followed her supposing that she was going  the tomb to weep there Mary therefore when she came where Jesus was and saw him fell down at his feet saying  him Lord if  hadst been here my brother had not died When Jesus therefore saw her weeping and the Jews also weeping who came with her he groaned in the spirit and was troubled and  Where have  laid him They say  him Lord come and see Jesus wept The Jews therefore  Behold how he loved him! But some of them  Could not this man who opened the es of him that was blind have caused that this man also should not die Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the tomb Now it was a cave and a stone lay against it Jesus  Take  away the stone Martha the sister of him that was dead   him Lord by this time the body decath for he  been dead four days Jesus   her  I not   that if  believedst  shouldest see the glory of God So they took away the stone And Jesus lifted up his es and  Father I thank  that  heardest me And I knew that  hearest me always but because of the multitude that standeth around I  it that they may believe that  didst send me And when he had thus spoken he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forth He that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with grave-clothes and his face was bound about with a napkin Jesus   them Loose him and let him go Many therefore of the Jews who came to Mary and beheld that which he did believed on him But some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them the things which Jesus had done The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council and  What do we for this man doeth many signs If we let him thus alone all men will believe on him and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation But a certain one of them Caiaphas being high priest that ar   them  know nothing at all nor do  take account that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people and that the whole nation perish not Now this he  not of himself but being high priest that ar he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation and not for the nation only but that he might also gather together into one the children of God that are scattered abroad So from that day forth they took counsel that they might put him to death Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews but departed thence into the country near to the wilderness into a city called Ephraim and there he tarried with the disciples Now the passover of the Jews was at hand and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the passover to purify themselves They sought therefore for Jesus and spake one with another as they stood in the temple What think  That he will not come to the feast Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given commandment that if any man knew where he was he should show it that they might take him Jesus therefore six days before the passover came to Bethany where Lazarus was whom Jesus raised from the dead So they made him a supper there and Martha served but Lazarus was one of them that sat at meat with him Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of pure nard very precious and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment But Judas Iscariot one of his disciples that should betray him  Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred shillings and given to the poor Now this he  not because he cared for the poor but because he was a thief and having the bag took away what was put therein Jesus therefore  Suffer her to keep it against the day of my burying For the poor  have always with you but me  have not always The common people therefore of the Jews learned that he was there and they came not for Jesus' sake only but that they might see Lazarus also whom he had raised from the dead But the chief priests took counsel that they might put Lazarus also to death because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away and believed on Jesus On the morrow a great multitude that had come to the feast when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem took the branches of the palm trees and went forth to meet him and cried out Hosanna Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord even the King of Israel And Jesus having found a young ass sat thereon as it is written Fear not daughter of Zion behold thy King cometh sitting on an ass's colt These things understood not his disciples at the first but when Jesus was glorified then remembered they that these things were written of him and that they had done these things  him The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead bare witness For this cause also the multitude went and met him for that they heard that he had done this sign The Pharisees therefore  among themselves Behold how  prevail nothing lo the world is gone after him Now there were certain Greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast these therefore came to Philip who was of Betha of Galilee and asked him saying Sir we would see Jesus Philip cometh and telleth Andrew Andrew cometh and Philip and they tell Jesus And Jesus answereth them saying The hour is come that the Son of man should be glorified Verily verily I say  you Except a grain of wheat fall into the earth and die it abideth by itself alone but if it die it beareth much fruit He that loveth his life loseth it and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it  life eternal If any man serve me let him follow me and where I am there shall also my servant be if any man serve me him will the Father honor Now is my soul troubled and what shall I say Father save me from this hour But for this cause came I  this hour Father glorify thy name There came therefore a voice out of heaven saying I have both glorified it and will glorify it again The multitude therefore that stood by and heard it  that it had thundered others  An angel  spoken to him Jesus answered and  This voice  not come for my sake but for your sakes Now is the judgment of this world now shall the prince of this world be cast out And I if I be lifted up from the earth will draw all men  myself But this he  signifying by what manner of death he should die The multitude therefore answered him We have heard out of the law that the Christ abideth for ever and how sast  The Son of man must be lifted up who is this Son of man Jesus therefore   them t a little while is the light among you Walk while  have the light that darkness overtake you not and he that walketh in the darkness knoweth not whither he goeth While  have the light believe on the light that  may become sons of light These things spake Jesus and he departed and hid himself from them But gh he had done so many signs before them t they believed not on him that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled which he spake Lord who  believed our report And to whom  the arm of the Lord been revealed For this cause they could not believe for that Isaiah  again He  blinded their es and he hardened their heart Lest they should see with their es and perceive with their heart And should turn And I should heal them These things  Isaiah because he saw his glory and he spake of him Nevertheless even of the rulers many believed on him but because of the Pharisees they did not confess it lest they should be put out of the synagogue for they loved the glory that is of men more than the glory that is of God And Jesus cried and  He that believeth on me believeth not on me but on him that sent me And he that beholdeth me beholdeth him that sent me I am come a light into the world that whosoever believeth on me may not abide in the darkness And if any man hear my sayings and keep them not I judge him not for I came not to judge the world but to save the world He that rejecteth me and receiveth not my sayings  one that judgeth him the word that I spake the same shall judge him in the last day For I spake not from myself but the Father that sent me he  given me a commandment what I should say and what I should speak And I know that his commandment is life eternal the things therefore which I speak even as the Father    me so I speak Now before the feast of the passover Jesus knowing that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world  his Father having loved his own that were in the world he loved them  the end And during supper the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the Father had given all the things into his hands and that he came forth from God and goeth  God riseth from supper and lath aside his garments and he took a towel and girded himself Then he poureth water into the basin and began to wash the disciples' feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded So he cometh to Simon Peter He   him Lord dost  wash my feet Jesus answered and   him What I do  knowest not now but  shalt understand hereafter Peter   him  shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered him If I wash  not   no part with me Simon Peter   him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus  to him He that is bathed needeth not save to wash his feet but is clean every whit and  are clean but not all For he knew him that should betray him therefore  he  are not all clean So when he had washed their feet and taken his garments and sat down again he   them Know  what I have done to you  call me Teacher and Lord and  say well for so I am If I then the Lord and the Teacher have washed your feet  also ought to wash one another's feet For I have given you an example that  also should do as I have done to you Verily verily I say  you a servant is not greater than his lord neither one that is sent greater than he that sent him If  know these things blessed are  if  do them I speak not of you all I know whom I have chosen but that the scripture may be fulfilled He that eateth my bread lifted up his heel against me From henceforth I tell you before it come to pass that when it is come to pass  may believe that I am he Verily verily I say  you he that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me When Jesus had thus  he was troubled in the spirit and testified and  Verily verily I say  you that one of you shall betray me The disciples looked one on another doubting of whom he spake There was at the table reclining in Jesus' bosom one of his disciples whom Jesus loved Simon Peter therefore beckoneth to him and   him Tell us who it is of whom he speaketh He leaning back as he was on Jesus' breast   him Lord who is it Jesus therefore answereth He it is for whom I shall dip the sop and give it him So when he had dipped the sop he taketh and giveth it to Judas the son of Simon Iscariot And after the sop then entered Satan into him Jesus therefore   him What  doest do quickly Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this  him For some ght because Judas had the bag that Jesus   him Buy what things we have need of for the feast or that he should give something to the poor He then having received the sop went out straightway and it was night When therefore he was gone out Jesus  Now is the Son of man glorified and God is glorified in him and God shall glorify him in himself and straightway shall he glorify him Little children t a little while I am with you  shall seek me and as I   the Jews Whither I go  cannot come so now I say  you A new commandment I give  you that  love one another even as I have loved you that  also love one another By this shall all men know that  are my disciples if  have love one to another Simon Peter   him Lord whither goest  Jesus answered Whither I go  canst not follow now but  shalt follow afterwards Peter   him Lord why cannot I follow  even now I will lay down my life for  Jesus answereth Wilt  lay down thy life for me Verily verily I say   The cock shall not crow till   denied me thrice Let not your heart be troubled believe in God believe also in me In my Father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you for I go to prepare a place for you And if I go and prepare a place for you I come again and will receive you  myself that where I am there  may be also And whither I go  know the way Thomas   him Lord we know not whither  goest how know we the way Jesus   him I am the way and the truth and the life no one cometh  the Father but by me If  had known me  would have known my Father also from henceforth  know him and have seen him Philip   him Lord show us the Father and it sufficeth us Jesus   him Have I been so long time with you and dost  not know me Philip he that  seen me  seen the Father how sast  Show us the Father Believest  not that I am in the Father and the Father in me the words that I say  you I speak not from myself but the Father abiding in me doeth his works Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father in me or else believe me for the very works' sake Verily verily I say  you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because I go  the Father And whatsoever  shall ask in my name that will I do that the Father may be glorified in the Son If  shall ask anything in my name that will I do If  love me  will keep my commandments And I will pray the Father and he shall give you another Comforter that he may be with you for ever even the Spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive for it beholdeth him not neither knoweth him  know him for he abideth with you and shall be in you I will not leave you desolate I come  you t a little while and the world beholdeth me no more but  behold me because I live  shall live also In that day  shall know that I am in my Father and  in me and I in you He that  my commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father and I will love him and will manifest myself  him Judas not Iscariot   him Lord what is come to pass that  wilt manifest thyself  us and not  the world Jesus answered and   him If a man love me he will keep my word and my Father will love him and we will come  him and make our abode with him He that loveth me not keepeth not my words and the word which  hear is not mine but the Father's who sent me These things have I spoken  you while t abiding with you But the Comforter even the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I   you Peace I leave with you my peace I give  you not as the world giveth give I  you Let not your heart be troubled neither let it be fearful  heard how I  to you I go away and I come  you If  loved me  would have rejoiced because I go  the Father for the Father is greater than I And now I have told you before it come to pass that when it is come to pass  may believe I will no more speak much with you for the prince of the world cometh and he  nothing in me but that the world may know that I love the Father and as the Father gave me commandment even so I do Arise let us go hence I am the true vine and my Father is the husbandman Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh it away and every branch that beareth fruit he cleanseth it that it may bear more fruit Already  are clean because of the word which I have spoken  you Abide in me and I in you As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine so neither can  except  abide in me I am the vine  are the branches He that abideth in me and I in him the same beareth much fruit for apart from me  can do nothing If a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and they gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned If  abide in me and my words abide in you ask whatsoever  will and it shall be done  you Herein is my Father glorified that  bear much fruit and so shall  be my disciples Even as the Father  loved me I also have loved you abide  in my love If  keep my commandments  shall abide in my love even as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love These things have I spoken  you that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be made full This is my commandment that  love one another even as I have loved you Greater love  no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends  are my friends if  do the things which I command you No longer do I call you servants for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth but I have called you friends for all things that I heard from my Father I have made known  you  did not choose me but I chose you and appointed you that  should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide that whatsoever  shall ask of the Father in my name he may give it you These things I command you that  may love one another If the world hateth you  know that it  hated me before it hated you If  were of the world the world would love its own but because  are not of the world but I chose you out of the world therefore the world hateth you Remember the word that I   you A servant is not greater than his lord If they persecuted me they will also persecute you if they kept my word they will keep yours also But all these things will they do  you for my name's sake because they know not him that sent me If I had not come and spoken  them they had not had sin but now they have no excuse for their sin He that hateth me hateth my Father also If I had not done among them the works which none other did they had not had sin but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father But this cometh to pass that the word may be fulfilled that is written in their law They hated me wit a cause But when the Comforter is come whom I will send  you from the Father even the Spirit of truth which proceedeth from the Father he shall bear witness of me and  also bear witness because  have been with me from the beginning These things have I spoken  you that  should not be caused to stumble They shall put you out of the synagogues a the hour cometh that whosoever killeth you shall think that he offereth service  God And these things will they do because they have not known the Father nor me But these things have I spoken  you that when their hour is come  may remember them how that I told you And these things I  not  you from the beginning because I was with you But now I go  him that sent me and none of you asketh me Whither goest  But because I have spoken these things  you sorrow  filled your heart Nevertheless I tell you the truth It is expedient for you that I go away for if I go not away the Comforter will not come  you but if I go I will send him  you And he when he is come will convict the world in respect of sin and of righteousness and of judgment of sin because they believe not on me of righteousness because I go to the Father and  behold me no more of judgment because the prince of this world  been judged I have t many things to say  you but  cannot bear them now Howbeit when he the Spirit of truth is come he shall guide you into all the truth for he shall not speak from himself but what things soever he shall hear these shall he speak and he shall declare  you the things that are to come He shall glorify me for he shall take of mine and shall declare it  you All things whatsoever the Father  are mine therefore  I that he taketh of mine and shall declare it  you A little while and  behold me no more and again a little while and  shall see me Some of his disciples therefore  one to another What is this that he   us A little while and  behold me not and again a little while and  shall see me and Because I go to the Father They  therefore What is this that he  A little while We know not what he  Jesus perceived that they were desirous to ask him and he   them Do  inquire among yourselves concerning this that I  A little while and  behold me not and again a little while and  shall see me Verily verily I say  you that  shall weep and lament but the world shall rejoice  shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into joy A woman when she is in travail  sorrow because her hour is come but when she is delivered of the child she remembereth no more the anguish for the joy that a man is born into the world And  therefore now have sorrow but I will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no one taketh away from you And in that day  shall ask me no question Verily verily I say  you if  shall ask anything of the Father he will give it you in my name Hitherto have  asked nothing in my name ask and  shall receive that your joy may be made full These things have I spoken  you in dark sayings the hour cometh when I shall no more speak  you in dark sayings but shall tell you plainly of the Father In that day  shall ask in my name and I say not  you that I will pray the Father for you for the Father himself loveth you because  have loved me and have believed that I came forth from the Father I came out from the Father and am come into the world again I leave the world and go  the Father His disciples say Lo now speakest  plainly and speakest no dark saying Now know we that  knowest all things and needest not that any man should ask  by this we believe that  camest forth from God Jesus answered them Do  now believe Behold the hour cometh a is come that  shall be scattered every man to his own and shall leave me alone and t I am not alone because the Father is with me These things have I spoken  you that in me  may have peace In the world  have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world These things spake Jesus and lifting up his es to heaven he  Father the hour is come glorify thy Son that the son may glorify  even as  gavest him authority over all flesh that to all whom   given him he should give eternal life And this is life eternal that they should know  the only true God and him whom  didst send even Jesus Christ I glorified  on the earth having accomplished the work which   given me to do And now Father glorify  me with thine own self with the glory which I had with  before the world was I manifested thy name  the men whom  gavest me out of the world thine they were and  gavest them to me and they have kept thy word Now they know that all things whatsoever   given me are from  for the words which  gavest me I have given  them and they received them and knew of a truth that I came forth from  and they believed that  didst send me I pray for them I pray not for the world but for those whom   given me for they are thine and all things that are mine are thine and thine are mine and I am glorified in them And I am no more in the world and these are in the world and I come to  Holy Father keep them in thy name which   given me that they may be one even as we are While I was with them I kept them in thy name which   given me and I guarded them and not one of them perished but the son of perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled But now I come to  and these things I speak in the world that they may have my joy made full in themselves I have given them thy word and the world hated them because they are not of the world even as I am not of the world I pray not that  shouldest take them from the world but that  shouldest keep them from the evil one They are not of the world even as I am not of the world Sanctify them in the truth thy word is truth As  didst send me into the world even so sent I them into the world And for their sakes I sanctify myself that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth Neither for these only do I pray but for them also that believe on me through their word that they may all be one even as  Father art in me and I in  that they also may be in us that the world may believe that  didst send me And the glory which   given me I have given  them that they may be one even as we are one I in them and  in me that they may be perfected into one that the world may know that  didst send me and lovedst them even as  lovedst me Father I desire that they also whom   given me be with me where I am that they may behold my glory which   given me for  lovedst me before the foundation of the world O righteous Father the world knew  not but I knew  and these knew that  didst send me and I made known  them thy name and will make it known that the love wherewith  lovedst me may be in them and I in them When Jesus had spoken these words he went forth with his disciples over the brook Kidron where was a garden into which he entered himself and his disciples Now Judas also who betrad him knew the place for Jesus oft-times resorted thither with his disciples Judas then having received the band of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons Jesus therefore knowing all the things that were coming upon him went forth and   them Whom seek  They answered him Jesus of Nazareth Jesus   them I am he And Judas also who betrad him was standing with them When therefore he   them I am he they went backward and fell to the ground Again therefore he asked them Whom seek  And they  Jesus of Nazareth Jesus answered I told you that I am he if therefore  seek me let these go their way that the word might be fulfilled which he spake Of those whom   given me I lost not one Simon Peter therefore having a sword drew it and struck the high priest's servant and cut off his right ear Now the servant's name was Malchus Jesus therefore   Peter Put up the sword into the sheath the cup which the Father  given me shall I not drink it So the band and the chief captain and the officers of the Jews seized Jesus and bound him and led him to Annas first for he was father in law to Caiaphas who was high priest that ar Now Caiaphas was he that gave counsel to the Jews that it was expedient that one man should die for the people And Simon Peter followed Jesus and so did another disciple Now that disciple was known  the high priest and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest but Peter was standing at the door wit So the other disciple who was known  the high priest went out and spake  her that kept the door and brought in Peter The maid therefore that kept the door   Peter Art  also one of this man's disciples He  I am not Now the servants and the officers were standing there having made a fire of coals for it was cold and they were warming themselves and Peter also was with them standing and warming himself The high priest therefore asked Jesus of his disciples and of his teaching Jesus answered him I have spoken openly to the world I ever taught in synagogues and in the temple where all the Jews come together and in secret spake I nothing Why askest  me Ask them that have heard me what I spake  them behold these know the things which I  And when he had  this one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand saying Answerest  the high priest so Jesus answered him If I have spoken evil bear witness of the evil but if well why smitest  me Annas therefore sent him bound  Caiaphas the high priest Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself They  therefore  him Art  also one of his disciples He denied and  I am not One of the servants of the high priest being a kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off  Did not I see  in the garden with him Peter therefore denied again and straightway the cock crew They lead Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium and it was early and they themselves entered not into the Praetorium that they might not be defiled but might eat the passover Pilate therefore went out  them and  What accusation bring  against this man They answered and   him If this man were not an evildoer we should not have delivered him up   Pilate therefore   them Take him yourselves and judge him according to your law The Jews   him It is not lawful for us to put any man to death that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled which he spake signifying by what manner of death he should die Pilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium and called Jesus and   him Art  the King of the Jews Jesus answered Sast  this of thyself or did others tell it  concerning me Pilate answered Am I a Jew Thine own nation and the chief priests delivered   me what   done Jesus answered My kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from hence Pilate therefore   him Art  a king then Jesus answered  sast that I am a king To this end have I been born and to this end am I come into the world that I should bear witness  the truth Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice Pilate   him What is truth And when he had  this he went out again  the Jews and   them I find no crime in him But  have a custom that I should release  you one at the passover will  therefore that I release  you the King of the Jews They cried out therefore again saying Not this man but Barabbas Now Barabbas was a robber Then Pilate therefore took Jesus and scourged him And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns and put it on his head and arrad him in a purple garment and they came  him and  Hail King of the Jews! and they struck him with their hands And Pilate went out again and   them Behold I bring him out to you that  may know that I find no crime in him Jesus therefore came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment And Pilate   them Behold the man! When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him they cried out saying Crucify him crucify him! Pilate   them Take him yourselves and crucify him for I find no crime in him The Jews answered him We have a law and by that law he ought to die because he made himself the Son of God When Pilate therefore heard this saying he was the more afraid and he entered into the Praetorium again and   Jesus Whence art  But Jesus gave him no answer Pilate therefore   him Speakest  not  me Knowest  not that I have power to release  and have power to crucify  Jesus answered him  wouldest have no power against me except it were given  from above therefore he that delivered me    greater sin Upon this Pilate sought to release him but the Jews cried out saying If  release this man  art not Caesar's friend every one that maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar When Pilate therefore heard these words he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment-seat at a place called The Pavement but in Hebrew Gabbatha Now it was the Preparation of the passover it was about the sixth hour And he   the Jews Behold your King! They therefore cried out Away with him away with him crucify him! Pilate   them Shall I crucify your King The chief priests answered We have no king but Caesar Then therefore he delivered him  them to be crucified They took Jesus therefore and he went out bearing the cross for himself  the place called The place of a skull which is called in Hebrew Golgotha where they crucified him and with him two others on either side one and Jesus in the midst And Pilate wrote a title also and put it on the cross And there was written JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS This title therefore read many of the Jews for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city and it was written in Hebrew and in Latin and in Greek The chief priests of the Jews therefore  to Pilate Write not The King of the Jews but that he  I am King of the Jews Pilate answered What I have written I have written The soldiers therefore when they had crucified Jesus took his garments and made four parts to every soldier a part and also the coat now the coat was wit seam woven from the top throughout They  therefore one to another Let us not rend it but cast lots for it whose it shall be that the scripture might be fulfilled which  They parted my garments among them And upon my vesture did they cast lots These things therefore the soldiers did But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother and his mother's sister Mary the wife of Clopas and Mary Magdalene When Jesus therefore saw his mother and the disciple standing by whom he loved he   his mother Woman behold thy son! Then  he to the disciple Behold thy mother! And from that hour the disciple took her  his own home After this Jesus knowing that all things are now finished that the scripture might be accomplished  I thirst There was set there a vessel full of vinegar so they put a sponge full of the vinegar upon hyssop and brought it to his mouth When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar he  It is finished and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit The Jews therefore because it was the Preparation that the bodies should not remain on the cross upon the sabbath for the day of that sabbath was a high day asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away The soldiers therefore came and brake the legs of the first and of the other that was crucified with him but when they came to Jesus and saw that he was dead already they brake not his legs howbeit one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side and straightway there came out blood and water And he that  seen  borne witness and his witness is true and he knoweth that he  true that  also may believe For these things came to pass that the scripture might be fulfilled A bone of him shall not be broken And again another scripture  They shall look on him whom they pierced And after these things Joseph of Arimathaea being a disciple of Jesus but secretly for fear of the Jews asked of Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus and Pilate gave him leave He came therefore and took away his body And there came also Nicodemus he who at the first came to him by night bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes about a hundred pounds So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths with the spices as the custom of the Jews is to bury Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden and in the garden a new tomb wherein was never man t laid There then because of the Jews' Preparation for the tomb was nigh at hand they laid Jesus Now on the first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early while it was t dark  the tomb and seeth the stone taken away from the tomb She runneth therefore and cometh to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved and   them They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb and we know not where they have laid him Peter therefore went forth and the other disciple and they went toward the tomb And they ran both together and the other disciple outran Peter and came first to the tomb and stooping and looking in he seeth the linen cloths lying t entered he not in Simon Peter therefore also cometh following him and entered into the tomb and he beholdeth the linen cloths lying and the napkin that was upon his head not lying with the linen cloths but rolled up in a place by itself Then entered in therefore the other disciple also who came first to the tomb and he saw and believed For as t they knew not the scripture that he must rise from the dead So the disciples went away again  their own home But Mary was standing wit at the tomb weeping so as she wept she stooped and looked into the tomb and she beholdeth two angels in white sitting one at the head and one at the feet where the body of Jesus had lain And they say  her Woman why weepest  She   them Because they have taken away my Lord and I know not where they have laid him When she had thus  she turned herself back and beholdeth Jesus standing and knew not that it was Jesus Jesus   her Woman why weepest  whom seekest  She supposing him to be the gardener   him Sir if   borne him hence tell me where   laid him and I will take him away Jesus   her Mary She turneth herself and   him in Hebrew Rabboni which is to say Teacher Jesus  to her Touch me not for I am not t ascended  the Father but go  my brethren and say to them I ascend  my Father and your Father and my God and your God Mary Magdalene cometh and telleth the disciples I have seen the Lord and that he had  these things  her When therefore it was evening on that day the first day of the week and when the doors were shut where the disciples were for fear of the Jews Jesus came and stood in the midst and   them Peace be  you And when he had  this he showed  them his hands and his side The disciples therefore were glad when they saw the Lord Jesus therefore  to them again Peace be  you as the Father  sent me even so send I you And when he had  this he breathed on them and   them Receive  the Holy Spirit whose soever sins  forgive they are forgiven  them whose soever sins  retain they are retained But Thomas one of the twelve called Didymus was not with them when Jesus came The other disciples therefore   him We have seen the Lord But he   them Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails and put my hand into his side I will not believe And after eight days again his disciples were within and Thomas with them Jesus cometh the doors being shut and stood in the midst and  Peace be  you Then  he to Thomas Reach hither thy finger and see my hands and reach hither thy hand and put it into my side and be not faithless but believing Thomas answered and   him My Lord and my God Jesus   him Because   seen me   believed blessed are they that have not seen and t have believed Many other signs therefore did Jesus in the presence of the disciples which are not written in this book but these are written that  may believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God and that believing  may have life in his name After these things Jesus manifested himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias and he manifested himself on this wise There was together Simon Peter and Thomas called Didymus and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee and the sons of Zebedee and two other of his disciples Simon Peter   them I go a fishing They say  him We also come with  They went forth and entered into the boat and that night they took nothing But when day was now breaking Jesus stood on the beach t the disciples knew not that it was Jesus Jesus therefore   them Children have  aught to eat They answered him No And he   them Cast the net on the right side of the boat and  shall find They cast therefore and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved   Peter It is the Lord So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord he girt his coat about him for he was naked and cast himself into the sea But the other disciples came in the little boat for they were not far from the land but about two hundred cubits off dragging the net full of fishes So when they got out upon the land they see a fire of coals there and fish laid thereon and bread Jesus   them Bring of the fish which  have now taken Simon Peter therefore went up and drew the net to land full of great fishes a hundred and fifty and three and for all there were so many the net was not rent Jesus   them Come and break your fast And none of the disciples durst inquire of him Who art  knowing that it was the Lord Jesus cometh and taketh the bread and giveth them and the fish likewise This is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to the disciples after that he was risen from the dead So when they had broken their fast Jesus  to Simon Peter Simon son of John lovest  me more than these He   him a Lord  knowest that I love  He   him Feed my lambs He  to him again a second time Simon son of John lovest  me He   him a Lord  knowest that I love  He   him Tend my sheep He   him the third time Simon son of John lovest  me Peter was grieved because he   him the third time Lovest  me And he   him Lord  knowest all things  knowest that I love  Jesus   him Feed my sheep Verily verily I say   When  wast young  girdedst thyself and walkedst whither  wouldest but when  shalt be old  shalt stretch forth thy hands and another shall gird  and carry  whither  wouldest not Now this he spake signifying by what manner of death he should glorify God And when he had spoken this he   him Follow me Peter turning about seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following who also leaned back on his breast at the supper and  Lord who is he that betrath  Peter therefore seeing him  to Jesus Lord and what shall this man do Jesus   him If I will that he tarry till I come what is that to  Follow  me This saying therefore went forth among the brethren that that disciple should not die t Jesus  not  him that he should not die but If I will that he tarry till I come what is that to  This is the disciple that beareth witness of these things and wrote these things and we know that his witness is true And there are also many other things which Jesus did the which if they should be written every one I suppose that even the world itself would not contain the books that should be written
